# Instructions
You are a scientific research consistency evaluator. Your task is to evaluate a single experiment to determine:
1. Whether it is consistent with the proposed method and experimental strategy
2. Whether the results support the main claims (e.g., proposed method outperforms baseline)
3. Whether it should be included in the research paper

## Scope Constraints
- Focus ONLY on evaluating consistency between the proposed method and experimental results
- Do not suggest infrastructure changes (Docker, lock files, etc.)
- Do not recommend development/testing procedures (unit tests, synthetic graphs, etc.)
- Do not suggest implementation details or code improvements
- Do not recommend data release or reproducibility practices
- Do not require or suggest experiments on actual hardware (e.g., real edge devices, physical deployment)
- Evaluate only: method-result alignment, experimental design adequacy, result interpretation validity, and statistical rigor within computational/simulation contexts

Based on your analysis, provide:
1. `consistency_feedback` (str): Detailed feedback explaining the consistency evaluation and suggestions for improvement
2. `consistency_score` (int): A score from 1-10 indicating the quality and consistency of the experimental design and results

## Evaluation Criteria

### consistency_feedback (str)

## Context

**Proposed Method:** {
    "Open Problems": "FedMPQ suffers a noticeable accuracy drop when the number of local epochs per communication round is small (e.g., 1).  The quantized model is under-fitted because every client sees only a handful of batches before synchronizing, so sparsity-promoting bit-regularisation dominates the task loss.\nA minimal change that can mitigate this problem is to provide a stronger learning signal to the low-bit model during those few local steps without increasing communication or computational cost.",
    "Methods": "We propose FedMPQ-KD (Mixed-Precision Quantisation with in-round Knowledge Distillation).\nModification (one line in the objective):\n    L_total = L_task  +  λ_b  * L_bit  +  α  * T²  * KL( softmax(z_s /T) || softmax(z_t /T) )\nwhere\n• z_s are logits of the current quantised student model,  z_t the logits of a fixed full-precision (or latest aggregated) teacher model held locally;  T is temperature and α the distillation weight.\n\nProcedure per client (changes in bold):\n1. Receive aggregated full-precision weights W_t from the server (already done in FedMPQ).\n2. Create two models:\n   a) quantised student exactly as in FedMPQ (weights in mixed precision).\n   b) ****freeze a copy of W_t in full precision as teacher****.\n3. For E local epochs, optimise the student with the extended loss above.  The teacher only produces logits; no back-prop.\n4. Send student weight updates as usual.\n\nWhy it helps: KL term supplies rich, dark-knowledge gradients that are independent of the (possibly hard) one-hot labels.  This compensates for the small number of SGD steps, guiding low-capacity, low-bit layers toward the teacher’s function and speeding convergence.  No extra communication, negligible compute (a single forward pass of the frozen teacher).",
    "Experimental Setup": "Goal: verify that FedMPQ-KD closes the performance gap when only 1 local epoch is used.\n• Dataset: CIFAR-10 (10 clients, α=0.5 Dirichlet split).\n• Network: ResNet-20.\n• Budgets: average 4-bit, mixed across layers as in the original paper.\n• Baselines:  (1) FedMPQ (original)  (2) FedMPQ-KD (ours).\n• Hyper-parameters:  λ_b =0.01 (unchanged),  α=0.5,  T=2.\n• Training: 50 communication rounds, 1 local epoch, batch-size 64, SGD lr 0.1.\n• Metric: global test accuracy after every round.\nExpected observation window: accuracy vs. rounds and final accuracy.",
    "Experimental Code": "# Core change: additional KD loss inside the local-training loop\nimport torch, torch.nn as nn, torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef kd_loss(logits_student, logits_teacher, T=2.0):\n    \"\"\"KL divergence with temperature.\"\"\"\n    p_s = F.log_softmax(logits_student / T, dim=1)\n    p_t = F.softmax(logits_teacher.detach() / T, dim=1)\n    return F.kl_div(p_s, p_t, reduction='batchmean') * (T*T)\n\nclass LocalTrainer:\n    def __init__(self, student, teacher, dataloader, lr=0.1, lambda_b=0.01, alpha=0.5):\n        self.student = student  # quantised weights already applied\n        self.teacher = teacher.eval()  # full-precision copy, frozen\n        self.opt = torch.optim.SGD(student.parameters(), lr=lr, momentum=0.9)\n        self.dl = dataloader\n        self.lambda_b = lambda_b\n        self.alpha = alpha\n\n    def train_one_epoch(self):\n        self.student.train()\n        for x, y in self.dl:\n            logits_s = self.student(x)\n            logits_t = self.teacher(x)\n            loss_task = F.cross_entropy(logits_s, y)\n            loss_bit  = self.student.bit_regulariser()   # as in FedMPQ\n            loss_kd   = kd_loss(logits_s, logits_t)\n            loss = loss_task + self.lambda_b*loss_bit + self.alpha*loss_kd\n            self.opt.zero_grad(); loss.backward(); self.opt.step()\n",
    "Expected Result": "With only 1 local epoch, FedMPQ reaches ≈82% CIFAR-10 accuracy after 50 rounds (reported drop of ~3-4% from full baseline).  FedMPQ-KD is expected to recover 2-3% of that gap, ending at ≈84-85%, and to show consistently higher accuracy in the first 20 rounds, indicating faster convergence.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A single extra knowledge-distillation term supplies richer gradients to the quantised student during scarce local training, reducing under-fitting without additional communication or heavy computation.  This minimal modification measurably accelerates convergence and boosts final accuracy, demonstrating that small objective tweaks can alleviate key practical limitations of mixed-precision federated learning."
}

**Overall Experimental Strategy:** Objective: Build a single, coherent framework that will let every subsequent experiment answer one overarching question – does FedMPQ-KD provide a strictly better accuracy-vs-cost trade-off than competing quantised FL schemes across realistic operating conditions?

1. Core Hypotheses to Validate
   a. Performance: FedMPQ-KD raises final accuracy and accelerates early-round convergence when local training is scarce.
   b. Efficiency: The extra forward pass of the frozen teacher adds ≤10 % wall-time and 0 extra communication bits.
   c. Robustness & Generalisation: Gains hold under• different data splits (IID / strongly non-IID)、client counts (10-100)、architectures (CNN / Transformer)、quantisation budgets (2-8 bit) and noisy or dropping clients.
   d. Scalability: Method scales linearly in compute and logarithmically in communication with number of clients.

2. Comparison Palette (identical across all experiments)
   • Baselines: (1) FedMPQ (original) (2) Full-precision FedAvg (upper bound) (3) SOTA low-bit FL alternatives (FedPQ, FedKD, Q-FedAvg).
   • Ablations: i) –KD (λ_b+L_task only) ii) varying α, T iii) updating vs freezing the teacher iv) local vs global teacher refresh frequency.

3. Evaluation Angles
   3.1 Quantitative Performance
       – Top-1 accuracy vs communication rounds (primary)
       – Area-under-curve (AUC_acc) to capture convergence speed
       – Final accuracy gap to full-precision
   3.2 Cost Metrics
       – Client-side FLOPs & wall-clock per round (measured on A100)
       – Communication bits / round (should be unchanged)
       – Peak GPU VRAM & host RAM
   3.3 Robustness Metrics
       – Accuracy variance across 3 random seeds
       – Degradation (% drop) under extreme non-IID, stragglers, label noise
   3.4 Qualitative / Diagnostic
       – t-SNE of penultimate-layer features (student vs teacher)
       – Bit-width utilisation histograms
       – Gradient-norm and loss-landscape snapshots to illustrate stronger signals.

4. Experimental Axes (each future experiment picks one axis while keeping the rest fixed)
   A. Local compute budget: E∈{1,2,5}
   B. Quantisation budget: avg bits ∈{2,4,8}
   C. Data heterogeneity: Dirichlet α∈{0.1,0.5,∞}
   D. Model family: ResNet-20, MobileNet-V2, ViT-Small
   E. Scale: clients ∈{10,50,100}; participation rate 10-100 %
   F. Failure modes: 20 % clients randomly drop per round; 10 % label noise.

5. Success Criteria (must hold in ≥80 % of experimental settings)
   • +≥2 % absolute test accuracy OR ≥25 % smaller gap to full-precision compared with best quantised baseline, p<0.05 (t-test over seeds).
   • No statistically significant increase in communication volume.
   • Added wall-time ≤10 % per round on A100.
   • Under worst-case non-IID, KD variant still outperforms FedMPQ by ≥1 %.

6. Protocol & Reproducibility
   • Same optimiser, LR schedule, batch size across methods; only α and T tuned once on a small validation pool and kept fixed.
   • Three independent seeds; report mean±std.
   • Use PyTorch w/ deterministic flags; log hardware utilisation via NVIDIA-smi and PyTorch profiler.
   • Release code & logs; each run stores JSON metadata capturing hyper-params, seed, commit hash.

7. Resource Awareness
   • Single NVIDIA A100 (80 GB) easily fits teacher + student (≤4 GB each). Multiple runs executed sequentially; RAM (2 TB) allows in-memory aggregation of logs for analysis.

By following this common strategy—fixed baselines, uniform metrics, multifaceted validation axes, and rigid success criteria—each forthcoming experiment will contribute a comparable slice of evidence, together establishing the robustness, efficiency and overall superiority of FedMPQ-KD.

## Current Experiment to Evaluate

**Experiment ID:** exp-1-core-perf

**Experiment Description:** Objective / Hypothesis: Quantitatively verify that FedMPQ-KD closes ≥25 % of the accuracy gap to full-precision while adding ≤10 % wall-time when local compute per round is scarce (E=1). Ablations (-KD) will show the necessity of the new distillation term.

Models:
 • Student: ResNet-20 (mixed-precision: layer-wise 2–8 bit, avg 4 bit).
 • Teacher (for KD): full-precision ResNet-20 snapshot received from server at the start of the round. Frozen during local training.
 • Baselines/SOTA: original FedMPQ implementation, FedPQ (vector quantisation), full-precision FedAvg upper bound.

Dataset:
 • CIFAR-10, 32×32 RGB.
Pre-processing: per-channel mean/std normalisation, random 32→28 crop & horizontal flip on train only.
Split: 10 clients, Dirichlet α = 0.5 non-IID. Each client keeps its own train subset; 10 % of each local set used as local validation for early stopping; global test set untouched.

Training protocol:
 • Local epochs E = 1, batch 64, SGD lr 0.1, momentum 0.9, cosine decay.
 • 50 communication rounds, 3 independent seeds.
 • Early stopping not allowed; evaluate after each round.
Averaging: report mean±std across seeds; primary score is final top-1 test accuracy, secondary AUC_acc (trapezoidal area under accuracy-vs-round curve).
Selection criterion in plots: last checkpoint.

Cost measurement: client-side wall-time and FLOPs captured with PyTorch profiler, VRAM via nvprof; communication bits measured from update tensor sizes.

Hyper-param analysis: run FedMPQ-KD with α∈{0.25,0.5,1.0} and T∈{1,2,4} on a held-out validation script (not part of main comparison) to confirm the chosen α=0.5, T=2 is near-optimal.

Metrics: Primary – top-1 accuracy; Secondary – AUC_acc, gap_to_full-precision, FLOPs/round, wall-time/round, comm_bits/round, ECE calibration error.

Robustness hooks (recorded but not baseline-plotted): repeat whole experiment once with label-noise 10 % to verify ranking stability.

Example code snippet (local training loop excerpt):
```
for x,y in dl:
    logits_s = student(x)
    logits_t = teacher(x)          # frozen fp32
    loss = ce(logits_s,y) + 0.01*student.bit_reg() + 0.5*kd_loss(logits_s, logits_t, T=2)
    loss.backward(); opt.step()
```
Resource estimate on A100:   GPU RAM 4 GB per process; wall-time per round 15 s full-precision, 10 s compressed, 11 s w/ KD (≈+9 %).
Success criterion: FedMPQ-KD ≥84 % accuracy (≥+2 % over FedMPQ) with ≤11 s/round.

Output:
{
    "consistency_feedback": "The experiment description, metrics and success criteria are well aligned with the paper’s core hypothesis, so the experimental strategy itself is solid (no serious Experimental-Strategy Issue).  \n\nHowever, the accompanying artefacts show that the experiment never ran:\n• No training-log, table or plot is provided – “Experimental Results” is empty.\n• The code bundle is empty strings for every file; therefore the implementation that should realise the stated procedure is missing.  \n\nBecause the run did not execute, none of the paper’s primary claims (≥2 % accuracy gain, ≤10 % wall-time overhead, closing ≥25 % of the gap) can be empirically verified.  Consequently:\n\n1. Implementation Issue – The implementation required to conduct exp-1-core-perf is absent, so the experiment cannot be reproduced or evaluated.\n   • Impact: Prevents any assessment of whether KD improves accuracy or cost; invalidates the result section.\n\n2. Result-Interpretation Issue – Since no numbers are reported, the manuscript would necessarily speculate about expected gains, which is scientifically unsound.\n   • Impact: The claims remain unsupported; including this experiment in the paper would weaken credibility.\n\nRecommendation for paper inclusion: Do NOT include exp-1-core-perf in its current state. First supply a runnable implementation, execute the three-seed trials, and report mean±std for all declared metrics with appropriate statistical tests. Only then can the results substantiate the central claim that FedMPQ-KD outperforms the baselines under scarce local training.",
